# Starter Projects

This directory contains starter templates for the Advent of Claude Code curriculum. Each subdirectory provides a foundation for specific days in the learning journey.

## Directory Structure

```
starter-projects/
├── days-1-9-basics/       # Basic Python project for foundational days
├── days-10-15-flask-api/  # Flask API template for web development days
└── day-17-debugging/      # Intentionally buggy code for debugging practice
```

## How to Use

1. **Copy** the relevant starter project to your working directory
2. **Follow** the daily exercises using the starter code as your foundation
3. **Compare** your progress with the solutions in the `solutions/` directory

## Days 1-9: Basics

A simple Python project structure to learn:
- Session management
- File references with `@`
- Shell commands with `!`
- Project initialization with `/init`
- Git workflows

## Days 10-15: Flask API

A Flask REST API template covering:
- Plan mode for architecture
