# Solutions

This directory contains example solutions and expected outputs for the Advent of Claude Code curriculum.

## How to Use

1. **Attempt the exercise first!** - The learning happens when you try
2. **Compare your approach** - Your solution may differ and still be correct
3. **Learn from differences** - Understand why solutions work

## Solution Format

Each solution includes:
- **Expected output**: What you should see when it works
- **Key code**: Critical implementation details
- **Common mistakes**: What often goes wrong
- **Learning notes**: Why the solution works

## Important Notes

- Solutions represent ONE way to solve each exercise
- Claude Code may suggest different (equally valid) approaches
- Focus on understanding the *concepts*, not copying code
- Your CLAUDE.md preferences may lead to different code styles

*Remember: The goal is learning, not just completing exercises. Take time to understand why each solution works.*
